After completing a bachelor's degree in physics at Fudan University, and later a master's degree in theoretical physics at Imperial College, I started my teaching career in international secondary education in 2011.

I have been teaching several A-Level syllabuses, including physics, pure mathematics, mechanics, and decision theory, during which I have gained experience and understanding in curriculum design, classroom management and student assessment.

I have also helped students with their university applications, among which there are offer holders of Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, UCL, KCL, Warwick, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, etc. I helped transform students' personal statements, from which I enjoyed learning about new things and brainstorming ideas. I also developed a series of systematic lectures for Oxford applicants to succeed in PAT and MAT tests, together with a set of Oxbridge mock interview questions for different subject options. These have now become part of my job that I find extremely exciting and refreshing.

I have specialties in mathematical modelling, LaTeX (currently for creating lecture slides and hand-outs), Python programming (mostly for reproducing simple classic games). I am also responsible for creating and maintaining this website (yes, that is why my personal page looks different from the others).

I am a badminton player and (used to be) a mid-distance runner.
